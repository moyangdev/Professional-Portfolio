## Bootcamp Challenge 02: Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

<b>User Story:</b><br />
AS AN employer<br />
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples<br />
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position<br />

<b>Acceptance Criteria:</b><br />
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work<br />
WHEN I load their portfolio<br />
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them<br />
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation<br />
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section<br />
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work<br />
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications<br />
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application<br />
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others<br />
WHEN I click on the images of the applications<br />
THEN I am taken to that deployed application<br />
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices<br />
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport<br />

<b>Mock-Up:</b><br />
The following animation shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
